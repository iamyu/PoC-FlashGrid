**Pre-Deployment**

    Q: Can we have a free trail before production?
    A: Yes, the requst can be submitted from https://www.flashgrid.io/skycluster-in-azure-free-trial/
    
    Q: Any problem to access FlashGrid official portal?
    A: if any troulbes to submit request or launch FlashGrid Launcher, better connect from a enviornment beyond China Great Firewall. Component like reCAPTCHA from FlashGrid office web site cannot work inside China.

    Q: There is not RHEL and FlashGrid image in China Azure Market Place, how can I start the production/trail deployment?
    A: Please contact FlashGrid to get image VHD and convert it as a VM image in your China Azure subscription. The VHD file is located on global Azure. It is better we have mirror site on China Azure blob service. 

    Sample script to convert the vhd to image. Assume the vhd (flashgrid-rhel-os.vhd) is saved in storage account mcsacn2racpoc with container named images.

        # login to China Azure
        Add-AzAccount -Environment AzureChinaCloud

        # Set image configuration. Sample deployment target region is China North 2.
        $imageConfig = New-AzImageConfig -Location 'China North 2';
        $osDiskVhdUri = "https://mcsacn2racpoc.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/images/flashgrid-rhel-os.vhd"
        Set-AzImageOsDisk -Image $imageConfig -OsType 'Linux' -OsState 'Generalized' -BlobUri $osDiskVhdUri;

        # Replace with your image name and target resource group name.
        New-AzImage -Image $imageConfig -ImageName 'YourImageName' -ResourceGroupName 'YourResourceGroup';


**Deployment**

    Q: Deployment Size from SkyCluster Launcher does not match with China VM Size, how to choose?
    A: While selecting the node size, the size listed on FlashGrid portal, like E16s_v3: 8 Cores, 128 GiB, storage: 32 disks max 384MB/s, 25600 IOPS, does not match with cores on https://docs.azure.cn/zh-cn/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-memory. As Azure sizing the VM as vCores and Esv3-series VM's feature IntelÂ® Hyper-Threading Technology, it should be the same. In case there is any sizing mis-match, the real VM sizing info is determined by Azure platform.

    Q: Shall we enable Accelerated Networking to pass through host Network?
    A: Accelerated Networking is automatically enabled after deployment.

    Test Image from FlashGrid as following version which should be able to support Accelerated Networking.

        Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.7 (Maipo)
        CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.7:GA:server
        Kernel: Linux 3.10.0-1062.7.1.el7.x86_64

    Q: Max cached and temp storage throughput is higher than VM un-Cached throughput, Does SkyCluster make any usage of the local temp SSD?
    A: 

    Q: Usable_Capacity = Number_of_Disks_per_Node x Disk_Size (because of mirroring between the nodes)? 
    A: The total SSD assigned to the cluster cannot be fully used by ASM due to redudant(mirror). So the ASM Usable_Capacity = Number_of_Disks_per_Node x Disk_Size x Node_Count / Redudant_Factor. For the two node cluster, Node_Count = Redudant_Factor = 2. 

**Post-Deployment**
    
    Q: After deploy the FlashGrid cluster to one subscription. does it support to move to different subscription?
    A: The subscription ID does not matter in China as it is not charged via MarketPlace in China. The cluster resources can be managed as normal resources. 

    Q: What is the usage for flashgrid-client-nsg?
    A: A Network Security Group resource, flashgrid-client-nsg, is created during the deployment but it does not associate with any subnet/nic. please review the rules to ensure if meet your network requirement.  

        Port required by FlashGrid
        - UDP 4801, 4802, 4803 and TCP 3260 between the cluster node VMs
        - TCP ports 1521 (or customized SCAN Listener port) and 1522 (or customized Local Listener port) for client and app server access
        - TCP port 22 for SSH access

    Q: what is the common CLI to verify SkyCluster has been configured properly?
    A: sudo flashgrid-cluster verify

    Q: Time Sync requirement for FlashGrid?
    A: 

    Q: The deployment is reported as successful but there is not fg-pri virtual NIC on quorum node. Also, there other virtual NIC is created on DB node. is it normal?


    Q: Does it have IPv6 support?


    Q: Storage Layout is as following. from wizard, we specificed 1024 x 3 and 512 x 3 for data disk. 5 GiB disk is used for disk group GRID. what is the usage for LUN0 107GiB?
